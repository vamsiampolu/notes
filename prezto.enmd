Prezto themes need to be downloaded and installed at:

    ~/.zprezto/modules/prompt

I am installing enhancd which provides enhanced cd functionality for my shell prompt.
The plugin requires the installation of interactive filtering tools such as percol
and peco in my workflow and those tools,due to their interactive nature are better
performing and more productive than grep.
